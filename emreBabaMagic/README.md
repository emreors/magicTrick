# Pure CSS Magic Trick

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/EmreOrs/pen/bGKzLjy](https://codepen.io/EmreOrs/pen/bGKzLjy).

A magic trick developed using HTML and CSS only... and not a single line of JavaScript! The great magician Al will guess your card using his mental powers.

This magic trick/joke is a CSS only variation of a funny Garfield magic trick that I saw online a few years back (I found a video of it and even have the cards in the same order to play a hommage, aka copied it shamelessly).

No images or JavaScript code were harmed in the making of this CSS magic trick... because none were used :P
